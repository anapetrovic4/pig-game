# pig-game
Welcome to the Pig Dice Game repository! This is a simple yet fun two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Take turns rolling the dice, strategically decide when to hold your score, and be the first to reach the winning threshold. Let the games begin! ðŸš€

## motivation
This is my first individual project that I have worked on, which has inspired me to pursue the field of web development event further. I did this projects as a part of my internship in frontend development.

## screenshots
The game rules all like this: There are two players who roll the dice, and they compete until one of them reaches a score of 100 points. If a player gets number 1 on the dice, all the current score they have accomplished is lost, and the game immediatelly switches to the opponent. Players need to strategically decide when they want to hold their score.
